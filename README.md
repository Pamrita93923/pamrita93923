Hello everyone! Myself Amrita a passionate Front-End Developer and an aspiring Data Analyst. I really enjoy creating websites that are interactive, easy to use, and look nice, while also working with data to find important insights.

I love learning new tools and technologies, building projects that can solve real-life problems, and improving my skills step by step. I work with HTML, CSS, Python, SQL, Excel, NumPy, and Pandas, and I like combining creativity and data to make projects that are both useful and meaningful.

I also enjoy exploring new ideas, trying out small experiments, and making my work more fun and interesting.
